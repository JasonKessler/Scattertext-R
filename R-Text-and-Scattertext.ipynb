I love watching the birds, and any other living creature roaming about.  I love the everything that grows, and there is a purpose for everything. I feel peace while near the ocean, or on a boat.  I feel at peace and in harmony while in the back yard, watching all the plants, trees, flowers, and weeds grow.  It is sad that so many people don't care about nature.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              </td><td>Yes, overall I am satisfied with my life.

Life could be much worse. I have been in worse times regarding money then right now. Im not rich but im doing just fine. I broke up with my girlfriend recently and although that was hard I knew we should have broken up long ago. I'm doing much better now. I have a few friends and I would do anything for them. My ex betraying me made me feel terrible  but I know that was her fault and not mine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              & 25 & 16 & 23 & 2\\\\\n",

There are too many things going on in my life that are making me anxious and/or sad right now.  I am coming up on my 50th birthday in a few days and it's hitting me hard.  Not that I'm getting older per se, but that I feel I have so little to show for it other than financial stability.  I feel like I've focused on the wrong things in my life and it's too late to go back and redo the most important things like family.  My only child will be leaving for college in the fall and I wish I had had more children but it's definitely too late for that.  I don't have a household full of laughter and love and that makes me sad, depressed, etc.  I know I need to refocus to bring harmony to my life but my negative feelings are so strong right now I am having trouble finding any balance. & Similar to being in harmony, I am not satisfied with my life.  I make plenty of money and have financial stability that many people would be envious of, but I have an emotional void.  I want to have more friends and people that I can count on but I have been so self focused that I have neglected friendships over the years.  I know this is something that I can do better at but it is hard to know where to start.

Life could be much worse. I have been in worse times regarding money then right now. Im not rich but im doing just fine. I broke up with my girlfriend recently and although that was hard I knew we should have broken up long ago. I'm doing much better now. I have a few friends and I would do anything for them. My ex betraying me made me feel terrible  but I know that was her fault and not mine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | 25 | 16 | 23 | 2 |\n",

I feel like I've focused on the wrong things in my life and it's too late to go back and redo the most important things like family.  My only child will be leaving for college in the fall and I wish I had had more children but it's definitely too late for that.

I make plenty of money and have financial stability that many people would be envious of, but I have an emotional void.

I am coming up on my 50th birthday in a few days and it's hitting me hard.  Not that I'm getting older per se, but that I feel I have so little to show for it other than financial stability.  I feel like I've focused on the wrong things in my life and it's too late to go back and redo the most important things like family.  My only child will be leaving for college in the fall and I wish I had had more children but it's definitely too late for that.  I don't have a household full of laughter and love and that makes me sad, depressed, etc.  I know I need to refocus to bring harmony to my life but my negative feelings are so strong right now I am having trouble finding any balance.\n",
